# Java Practice Projects

This repository contains multiple **standalone Java projects** organized into categories: **Loops, Arrays, Strings, Methods, OOP, and Inheritance & Polymorphism**.  
Each project has its own folder with a `src/` directory and a single `Main.java` file containing the solution.

## 🚀 How to Compile & Run
Navigate to the project folder you want to run and execute:

```sh
cd ProjectName/src
javac Main.java
java Main
```

Example:
```sh
cd Loops_1_Factorial/src
javac Main.java
java Main
```

## ✨ Notes
- All class names are **Main** for simplicity.  
- Each program is **self-contained** and can be compiled & executed independently.  
- Excluded exercises are intentionally omitted as per requirements.  

Happy Coding! 🚀
